## Long Exposure Effect

One of my favorite photography techniques is long exposure, the process of creating a photo that shows the effect of passing time, something that traditional photography does not capture. This is an experiment on converting a video file into a jpg file with long time exposure effect, with OpenCV and Python.

The source video file can be found at [videohive.net][https://videohive.net/item/milky-way-from-ruined-observatory/12467677]
The output is shown below
