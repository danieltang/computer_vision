## Long Exposure Effect

One of my favorite photography techniques is long exposure, the process of creating a photo that shows the effect of passing time, something that traditional photography does not capture. This is an experiment on converting a video file into a jpg file with long time exposure effect, with OpenCV and Python.

The first example showing here is starry night with earth rotation tracked by the milky way. The source video file can be found at [videohive.net][https://videohive.net/item/milky-way-from-ruined-observatory/12467677]
The output is shown below

The second example is showing the silky smooth sea waves. The source video is downloaded at [videohive.net][https://videohive.net/item/waves-breaking-at-cathedral-rocks/19079293]. And the output is shown below
